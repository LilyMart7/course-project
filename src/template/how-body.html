                        writing service again? We understand your anger and frustration, because many clients who end up
                        with us have experienced just what you have. They paid for a paper and received a terrible
                        product which they could not submit without completely re-writing it or, worse, had to trash it
                        completely.

                        customers, and they are aware of every stage their paper is at. Our company together with its

                        process is the same.When you use us, here is what happens:</div>

                    <div class="col how-block-body"><i class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></i>1. Place Your Order</div>
                    <div class="col how-block-text">Use our user-friendly form to place your order. This form allows you
                        to indicate
                        the academic level (high school, undergraduate, etc.), the specific topic of the piece, type of
                        piece (essay, report, research paper, etc.) and all other requirements, such as length, number
                        and types of resources to be used, citation format, etc. Also on this form, you will find the
                        place to indicate your deadline. This is critically important. We urge you to give us as much
                        time as possible to complete the work, but if the order is truly urgent, we will still accept it
                        and complete it exactly by the deadline. Next step to make is to pay for your order. The prices
                        are based upon our pricing policy which is very flexible and depends upon the work and the
                        deadline.
                        </br>
                        </br>
                        An order with a short deadline will be immediately assigned to a team of academicians in the
                        subject field who will work together to meet the deadline. If the deadline provides more time,
                        the paper will be transferred to our contracted writers. It will be given to the writer with an
                        appropriate specialization and suitable academic level.

                        </br>
                        Once you have completed the registration form, you will be assigned a customer ID, which you
                        will use to access your personal account. Your account dashboard is where you place your orders.

                        writer. At your account you can upload any additional information that you think your writer may
                        need, including samples of your own writing for your writer to emulate. You can also contact
                        your writer directly, to know he or she is on the right track and that your order is progressing
                        according to your expectations. A messaging system has been set up for this purpose. However,
                        you can upload additional information before we find a suitable writer or during the initial
                        stages of the writing process.

                        necessary, and scanned for plagiarism, so that we can ensure that it is structurally sound,
                        grammatically correct and completely original. The work is then uploaded for you to download and
                        is sent to your email address as well.
