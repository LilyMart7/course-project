                    <div class="col faq-text">You will set up a personal account by your email and a selected password.
                        You may use this account to monitor the progress of your order. You may also upload additional
                        instructions, samples of your own writing for your writer to review, and use the links to
                        communicate with your writer or with our customer support team. Once you see all of the options
                        on your account, you will see how easy it is to use.</div>

                    <div class="col faq-top">2. Will my writer and I be able to communicate with one another?</div>

                    <div class="col faq-text">Absolutely! Once you have your account, you may send and receive messages
                        to and from your writer during the entire process of order fulfillment. This is an option that
                        other writing services do not offer, since they do not assign specific writers to each task.
                        EssaysService.com encourages such communication, because we want you to be able to refine
                        instructions and see the progress of your order at any time, day or night.</div>

                    <div class="col faq-text">There are a variety of options for making a payment, including all major
                        credit cards, PayPal, BACS, wire transfer, checks or money orders, etc. You will find these
                        options when you go to the payment link. We assure that our payment methods are 100% secure. We
                        do not store anyone’s payment information or payment data from credit cards or accounts, and
                        there are never any surcharges or double billing. We have refined our payment process to be
                        absolutely user friendly. Payment is easy and completely secure at EssaysService.com.</div>

                    <div class="col faq-top">4. How do you guarantee that I will be satisfied with your work?</div>

                    <div class="col faq-text">Once you have received your essay, paper, report, etc., you have two days
                        from the email delivery to request revisions. We are happy to make any changes FREE of charge if
                        our writer haven’t followed your instructions precisely. You have 48 hours to apply for a free
                        revision from the moment that order was uploaded in the system. If the final produce does not
                        meet your requirements, you can ask for a refund, and our Quality Control Team will review your
                        complaint. If our writer did not follow your specifications, we will refund your order.</div>

                    <div class="col faq-top">5. Will others know I have used your service?</div>

                    <div class="col faq-text">Only if you choose to tell them! We have a strict privacy policy, and we
                        never reveal any information about our customers and their orders. In addition, no one will ever
                        find the work you ordered anywhere online. Confidentiality of our customers is one of our most
                        important guarantees.</div>

                    <div class="col faq-top">6. Can I specify the format or is there a standard one you use?</div>

                    <div class="col faq-text">Our standard format is Arial font, 12 point, double-spaced, with one-inch
                        margins all the way around. If you need a different format (some instructors require Times New
                        Roman, for example), all you do is let us know when you place your order. You put these types of
                        instructions in the “Comments” box you will find on the order page.</div>

                    <div class="col faq-top">7. Do your essays and papers come from pre-written databases?</div>

                    <div class="col faq-text">Absolutely not! At EssaysService.com, all written work completed for a
                        customer is created from scratch, and follows the specific guidelines set by the customer. We
                        keep no databases of academic works, and you will never see your work anywhere else. We scan
                        each order with the help of 4 plagiarism search engines and ensure 100% authenticity. If you
                        come across plagiarism in your paper, we will refund your money. However, you will have to send
                        us a Turnitin plagiarism report to prove that our writer plagiarized (which never happens at
                        essaysservice.com).</div>

                    <div class="col faq-top">9. How do you set your prices?</div>

                    <div class="col faq-text">Our rates are available on the order form. However, please understand that
                        prices vary depending upon a couple of variables. First, of course, is the urgency of the
                        deadline. When you place an order that must be completed in a very short period of time, we
                        usually have to assign a few professionals, especially if significant research is required, in
                        order to complete it in a superior manner. The other component of our pricing system is the
                        academic level of the order. While a high school term paper can certainly be written by one with
                        a Bachelor’s degree, a college paper will require a writer with at least a Master’s Degree.
                        Orders from graduate students will necessitate a Ph.D. academician, and the charge, of course,
                        will be higher. EssaysService.com wants to be both fair and reasonable in its pricing, and our
                        policies reflect this commitment.</div>
