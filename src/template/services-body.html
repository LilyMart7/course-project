                        We understand! Most services charge a set price-per-page, for anything from a high school
                        5-paragraph essay to a Ph.D. dissertation. This should raise an immediate red flag to you. No
                        honest and ethical service can do this without using second-rate writers and databases of
                        pre-written papers.</div>
                </div>


                <div class="row ">
                    <div class="col price-text-1">At EssaysService.com, our pricing is uniquely designed to fit all of
                        the factors involved in creating an original, professionally-written work at any academic level
                        and with any deadline required. The tables that follow will provide you important information
                        about the cost of the work you need. The price-per-page is based upon double-spaced, standard
                        font, of approximately 300 words per page.
                        You will note that prices-per-page vary depending upon the following:
                        </br>
                        </br>
                        <i class="fas fa-dove"></i> Length of paper – the greater the length requirement, the less per page cost
                        </br>
                        </br>
                        <i class="fas fa-dove"></i> Deadline – the price declines as the deadline time frame lengthens
                        </br>
                        </br>
                        <i class="fas fa-dove"></i>Academic level – high school writing is less expensive than that of college and graduate levels
                        </br>
                        </br>
                        Considering that we use degreed professionals who write each work from scratch as it is ordered,
                        our prices are extremely reasonable. We are not the cheapest service, but we do not want to be.
                        We are, however, as reasonable as you will find for the quality we deliver.
                        There are many products and pricing levels that will meet your needs and fit your budget, and
                        this is why so many students return to EssaysService.com over and over again. No matter what
                        your writing need, we have the writer, the quality, and the price for you!
